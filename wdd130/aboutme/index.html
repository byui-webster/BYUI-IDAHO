    <h2>MICHAEL AFOLAYAN</h2>
    <p>I was the third child born to a family of eight in Nigeria in the late 80s. I'm a graduate member of the Nigerian Institute of Management Chartered and I have a degree in public administration and I am self-employed.</p>
    <p>Right now, I am a Catholic, but I am still learning about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Sure! What you expect can happen. I also believe in equality and love our Heavenly Father's things. I am single, and I don't know if my partner is here or not. Yeah! I can't wait to get her from the same tech, so we can all become techies! Though God's will is supreme.</p>
        It took me so long to figure out what God had in store for me, but it wasn't my fault. Maybe it was because I came from a different part of the world. Yes! I just got a call, and what do you think it is? That's a TECH call. I'm taking my first certificate course in web and computer programming, and because I'm new to the tech world, I'd love to learn from as many tech experts as possible here.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to build a strong career in the Tech Industry with my wonderful colleagues.</p>

            <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great outdoors. </p>
