                    <p>Your view board is the third part of the website that I would like to build. This page would be more of an interactive 
                        page where the prospective buyers can set the delivery location, choose their desired products by browsing the shops 
                        that deliver near them, and receive their products at their door steps in no time. This concept gives me butterflies 
                        because I do not have a lot of experience creating pages like this one. If I have trouble creating the message board 
                        and getting it to function properly, I may just wind up having a non-responsive webpage instead. Especially considering 
                        that I would have to build a database of users in order for individuals to be able to create an account on the webpage, 
                        log in, and also put their selected products in their carts. You can create an account or login in case you 
                        have an existing account to make your shopping easy so as to be able to add whatever you shop to your cart and setup 
                        your pickup stations for your delivery and as well track your delivery by clicking 
                        <a href="https://www.jumia.com.ng/sp-delivery-timelines/">here.</a>

                    <p>On the other hand, visitors who are interested in receiving our newsletter would also be able to subscribe to our 
                        newsletter to keep them abreast of various updates that would be featured on the E-Commerce Solution Pack webpage. 
                        This seems like the kind of thing that would be a lot of fun to write. I might ask some other people to help me 
                        write some extra features that I may need to add to the website. You can create an account or login in case you 
                        have an existing account to be able to subscribe to our communications to receive special offers and latest news by 
                        clicking <a href="https://www.jumia.com.ng/sp-delivery-timelines/">here.</a>
